# Enhanced Timeline JavaScript Challenge v1.0

This script was created after solving a simple challenge: Create an `init` and `addEvent` functions that initialize a 10-period "match" and able you to add events and visualize them in a timeline.

After finishing it I kept working on it out of curiosity, I wanted to control some possible scenarios and adding a scoreboard and some subtle animations.

This is the result of playing a bit with the original challenge.
